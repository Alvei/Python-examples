    "A recursive solution is one where the solution to a problem is expressed as an operation on a simplified version of the same problem. Therefore, a recursive algorithm is an algorithm which calls itself with \"smaller (or simpler)\" input values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.\n",

    "A typical recursive function has two parts:\n",
    "1. **A base case**: This is the value that the function returns for the \"simplest\" input. A recursive function has to terminate to be used in a program. A recursive function terminates, if with every recursive call the solution of the problem is downsized and moves towards a base case. A base case is a case, where the problem can be solved without further recursion. A recursion can lead to an infinite loop, if the base case is not met in the calls.\n",

    "    problem gets closer to the base case.\n",

    "    fewer digit that x); Strings, tuples, and lists recur on slices (e.g., x[1:]\n",
    "    fewer characters or fewer values).\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) ASSUMING ALL RECURSIVE CALLS SOLVE THEIR SMALLER SUBPROBLEMS CORRECTLY,\n",
