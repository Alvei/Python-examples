    Namedtuple makes your tuples self-document. You can easily understand what is going
    on by having a quick glance at your code. And as you are not bound to use integer
    indexes to access members of a tuple, it makes it more easy to maintain your code.
    Moreover, as namedtuple instances do not have per-instance dictionaries, they are
    lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples. This makes them faster
    than dictionaries. However, do remember that as with tuples, attributes in namedtuples
    are immutable.
    By implementing the special methods __len__ and __getitem__, our FrenchDeck behaves like
    a standard Python sequence, allowing it to benefit from core language features (e.g.,
    iteration and slicing). Iteration is often implicit. If a collection has no __contains__
    method, the in operator does a sequential scan.
