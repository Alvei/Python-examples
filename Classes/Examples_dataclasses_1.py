""" dataclasses remove boilerplates when defining classes.
    They automatically add generated special methods like __init__(), __repr__(), __eq__()

    Parameters:
    frozen=True:        become immutable and you can use them in hash

    order=Truee:        __lt__, __le__,__gt__ and __ge__ methods will be automagically generated.
                        You can make comparison of objects as if they were tuples of their fields in order.

    field function:     Needs to be imported. If field=False, cannot initialize variable and
                        it will be done by __post_init__()
    __post_init__():    Is called by __init__ to do something.

    asdict():           Needs to be imported. Returns properties as a dict
    astuple():          Needs to be imported. Returns properties as a tuple

    - rationale = define classes which exist primarily to store values accessible by attribute lookup
    - support static type checkers"""
